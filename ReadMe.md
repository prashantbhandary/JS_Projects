# Adding the Projects as much I Can

## How far I have done till now?
 - Up until now, I have completed projects 01 to 06 while learning JavaScript. These projects were done while watching YouTube videos side by side.

- So, they may not be very efficient. We must strive to practice more on different projects by ourselves. Therefore, starting from project 07, I will work independently and explain what I did each day.

## From project 07 :(ROCK_PAPER_SCISSOR)
- Hey Programmer! Today I made a rock-paper-scissors game that we used to play physically in our childhood, now adapted for our computers.
I built the game using simple JavaScript and incorporated async concepts like setTimeout() and setInterval() to make it more realistic, adding a 1500 ms delay to create the feeling of actually playing rock-paper-scissors.
Added some audio to make fun.
I utilized the concepts I have learned !
